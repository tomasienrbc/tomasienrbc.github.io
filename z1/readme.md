# Browser Camera Template

## Installation

I think there's no installation at all! Just open index.html in your browser.

I tried to keep this extremely, extremely minimal to just be a way to jump start any experiments I want to do or anyone else wants to do.

I believe we should follow this format:

- master: anything that is a very basic building block improvement or addition that every project would want to use, commit it to master
- branch? fork?: any deeper experiment (such as running Open CV off of this?) should probably be a branch or a fork. I dunno! 

## Summary

This is a basic HTML/JS/CSS template that will jumpstart you to do the following things:

- access the user's camera
- stream the camera's contents to the user in the browser
- stream the camera's contents to your code
- overlay a guide to the user

It is based on this project: https://github.com/PaulKinlan/qrcode

with all the QR stuff stripped out
